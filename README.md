# Z- Algorithm 

Z- Algorithm is a Exact pattern matching algorithm with time complexity of O(n) n=length of pattern + length of text.

## Steps to run

1. clone or download the repository. To clone open the command line and run the below command.
```
git clone 
```

2. Move to the cloned/downloaded directory.
```
cd /pathWhereItWasCloned/zAlgo
```

3. Run the python file to get the result both in standard output as-well into a "sol_{x}" result file. Pass the input file as arguments, below code has 2 example, default input is "sample_0".
```
# Default runs with sample_0
python3 exactPatternMatching.py 

# to test sample_1
python3 exactPatternMatching.py --input sample_1

# to test sample_2
python3 exactPatternMatching.py --input sample_2
```


Given that the input file has format "sample_{x}", the code will automatically save it to a file named "sol_{x}" [x can be any value, it will be parsed in the code].
